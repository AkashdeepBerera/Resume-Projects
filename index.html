      <h2>What is AWS Lambda?</h2>
      <p>AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It allows you to focus on building your application logic instead of worrying about infrastructure management.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>**Pay-per-use:** You only pay for the resources your code consumes, making it cost-effective for applications with varying workloads.</li>
        <li>**Scalability:** AWS Lambda automatically scales your code to meet demand, ensuring high availability and responsiveness.</li>
        <li>**Event-driven:** Your code is triggered by events like file uploads, API requests, or changes in other services, simplifying application development.</li>
        <li>**Wide range of use cases:** You can use Lambda for various tasks, including data processing, web applications, and backend services.</li>
      </ul>
